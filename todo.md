- bug: links not visible until nodes are dragged for the first time
- bug: first click into RTE is not really good, for those with bullet lists content

deleting keeps mentions
renames update everywhere

selection and sidebar with props for the current selection

---- nice to haves ----

hovering colors mentions and/or link

detect cycles

links should be non-interactive -> maybe do something fun

🟣 product decisions:

- links always to from originating node (left) to the mentioned node (right), and handles for the link are always on the right and left edge, respectively
